# Background Context

Along with this project, you have been attributed an Ubuntu server, living in a datacenter far far away. You will connect using ssh command by using the RSA key. We’ve configured your server with the public key you will create (“How-To” below) and share it in your intranet profile.

You can access your server information in the my servers section of the intranet, each line with contains the IP and username you should use to connect via ssh.

Note: Your server is configured with an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS environment.
